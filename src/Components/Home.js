            I have about twenty-years of experience in the film industry. As a
            consequence of immigration, I had to start everything from new, for
            example learning new languages and adapting to new environments. The
            latest novel environment encouraged me to decide to learn to
            program, which is a passion I never had the possibility to learn and
            work with in my homeland. During the past year I extensively studied
            full stack web-development at the coding school "Hack Your Future",
            Copenhagen, and had the chance to be part of "Chattie" a messaging
            app.
